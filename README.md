# FIFA 21 Dataset Cleaning and Transformation âš½ðŸ“Š  

## **Overview**  
This project showcases my expertise in data cleaning and transformation by addressing real-world data quality issues in the FIFA 21 dataset. The goal was to prepare the dataset for analysis by ensuring consistency, accuracy, and usability.  

## **Skills Demonstrated**  
- Advanced Excel techniques, including Power Query transformations.  
- Data standardization and format unification.  
- Problem-solving for real-world messy datasets.  

## **Project Highlights**  
- Addressed challenges in inconsistent wage and contract data.  
- Standardized height and weight formats for uniformity.  
- Applied advanced transformations to streamline the data cleaning process.  

## **Dataset Summary**  
- **Source**: FIFA 21 player data.  
- **Key Columns**: Player names, ratings, contracts, ages, wages, and physical attributes.  

## **Challenges and Solutions**  
1. **Inconsistent Wage Formats**  
   - **Problem**: Wages were represented in varying formats (e.g., "â‚¬100K").  
   - **Solution**: Used Power Query to unify and convert values.  

2. **Contract Start and End Dates**  
   - **Problem**: Dates were unstructured.  
   - **Solution**: Separated and standardized the dates for clarity.  

## **Key Takeaways**  
- Enhanced the dataset's analytical readiness.  
- Improved data consistency for actionable insights.
